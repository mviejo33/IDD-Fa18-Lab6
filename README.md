# ChatBot

*A lab report by Manuel Viejo*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, fork [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab6). You'll need to upload any code you change into your fork, as well as upload a video of a friend or classmate using your chatbot.

## Make the ChatBot your own

**Describe what changes you made to the baseline chatbot here. Don't forget to push your modified code to this repository.**

I made a chatbot for ordering pizza. It asks the user for the type of crust, cheese and for his/her address. I made sure that the user has to write the exact string for the cheese. The chatbot considers the user's answers when replying, for example, it says "Nice, thin then" when refering to the pizza crust.
